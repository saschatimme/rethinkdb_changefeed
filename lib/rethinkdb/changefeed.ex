defmodule RethinkDB.Changefeed do
  @moduledoc """
  A behaviour for implementing RethinkDB change feeds.

  The `Changefeed` behaviour is a superset of the `GenServer` behaviour. It adds some return
  values and some callbacks to make handling updates simple.

  A very simple example Changefeed:

      defmodule PersonFeed do
        
        use RethinkDB.Changefeed

        def init(opts) do
          id = Dict.get(opts, :id)
          db = Dict.get(opts, :db)
          query = RethinkDB.Query.table("people")
            |> RethinkDB.Query.get(id)
            |> RethinkDB.Query.changes
          {:subscribe, query, db, nil}
        end

        def handle_update(%{"new_val" => data}, _) do
          {:next, data}
        end

        def handle_call(:get, _from, data) do
          {:reply, data, data}
        end
      end

  The example shows one of many patterns. In this case, we are keeping a local
  copy of the record and updating it whenever it changes in the database. Clients
  in the application can access the data via `Changefeed.call(pid, :get)`.

  The same pattern can be used on a sequence:

      defmodule TeamFeed do
        
        use RethinkDB.Changefeed

        def init(opts) do
          name = Dict.get(opts, :name)
          team = Dict.get(opts, :team) # team is a map of ids to maps
          db = Dict.get(opts, :db)
          query = RethinkDB.Query.table("people")
            |> RethinkDB.Query.filter(%{team: name})
            |> RethinkDB.Query.changes
          {:subscribe, query, db, team}
        end

        def handle_update(data, team) do
          team = Enum.reduce(data, team, fn ->
            # no `old_val` means a new entry was created
            %{"new_val" => val, "old_val" => nil}, acc -> 
              Dict.put(acc, val["id"], val)
            # no `new_val` means an entry was deleted
            %{"new_val" => nil, "old_val" => val}, acc -> 
              Dict.delete(acc, val["id"])
            # otherwise, we have an update
            %{"new_val" => val}, acc ->
              Dict.put(acc, val["id"], val)
          end)
          {:next, team}
        end

        def handle_call(:get, _from, data) do
          {:reply, data, data}
        end
      end

  A changefeed is designed to handle updates and to update any state associated with
  the feed. If a publisher subscriber model is desired, a GenEvent can be used in
  conjunction with a changefeed. Here's an example:

      defmodule EventFeed do
        
        use RethinkDB.Changefeed
        def init(opts) do
          gen_event = Dict.get(opts, :gen_event)
          db = Dict.get(opts, :db)
          query = RethinkDB.Query.table("events")
            |> RethinkDB.Query.changes
          {:subscribe, query, db, gen_event}
        end

        def handle_update(data, gen_event) do
          Enum.each(data, fn
            # no `old_val` means a new entry was created
            %{"new_val" => val, "old_val" => nil}, acc -> 
              GenEvent.notify(gen_event,{:create, val})
            # no `new_val` means an entry was deleted
            %{"new_val" => nil, "old_val" => val}, acc -> 
              GenEvent.notify(gen_event,{:delete, val})
            # otherwise, we have an update
            %{"new_val" => val, "old_val" => old_val}, acc ->
              GenEvent.notify(gen_event,{:update, old_val, val})
          end)
          {:next, gen_event}
        end
      end
